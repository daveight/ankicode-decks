Description:
 Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). 
 Assume a BST is defined as follows: 
 
 The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. 
 The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. 
 Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
