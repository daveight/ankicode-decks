Given a subset of integers, determine whether a given set can be partitioned into 2 subset, such that
sum of elements in both subsets is the same.

Example #1:
[1, 10, 2, 11, 2]

Output: true
This array can be partitioned as [1, 10, 2] and [11, 2]

Example #2:
[1, 100, 200]

Output: false
There is no partitioning which will satisfy the condition
