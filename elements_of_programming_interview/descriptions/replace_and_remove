Consider the following two rules that are to be applied to an array of characters.
• Replace each 'a' by two 'd's.
• Delete each entry containing a 'b'.
For example, applying these rules to the array (a,c,d,b,b,c,a) results in the array (d,d,c,d,c,d,d).
Write a program which takes as input an array of characters, and removes each 'b' and replaces each 'a' by two 'd's.
