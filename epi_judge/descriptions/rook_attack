This problem is concerned with computing squares in a chessboard which can be atÂ¬ tacked by rooks that have been placed
at arbitrary locations.
Write a program which takes as input a 2D array A of Is and Os, where the Os encode the positions of rooks on an n X m
chessboard and updates the array to contain Os at all locations which can be attacked by rooks.
