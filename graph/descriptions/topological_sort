Perform topological sort of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
A topological sort of a DAG G is a linear ordering of all its vertices such that if G contains an edge (u, v), then u appears before v in the ordering.

For example:
[0:[],
 1:[],                 (5)  (4)
 2:[3],                /  \ /  \
 3:[1],              (2)  (0)  (1)
 4:[0,1],              \       /
 5:[0,2]]                 (3)

Result can be the following:
5 2 3 1 0 4
