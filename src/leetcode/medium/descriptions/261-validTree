Description:
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges 
(each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these 
edges make up a valid tree. 
For example: 
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true. 
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.
Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. 
Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will 
not appear together in edges.
