Time : O(N); Space: O(N)
 
Description: 
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values. 
For example: 
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3}, 
         1
           \
            2
           /
          3
return [1,3,2]. 
Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
