An array of integers naturally defines a set of lines parallel to the Y-axis, starting from x = 0 as. The goal of this
problem is to find the pair of lines that together with the X-axis "trap" the most water.
Write a program which takes as input an integer array and returns the pair of entries that trap the maximum amount of
water.
