Suppose A = (0,l,2,0,2,l,l),and the pivot indexis 3. Then A[3] = 0, so (0,0,1,2,2,1,1) is a valid partitioning.
For the same array, if the pivot index is 2, then A[2] = 2, so the arrays (0,1,0,1,1, 2,2) as well as (0,0,1,1,1, 2,2)
are valid partitionings.
Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that all elements less
than A[i] (the "pivot") appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot, followed by elements greater than the
pivot.
