Run-length encoding (RLE) compression offers a fast way to do efficient on-the-fly compression and decompression of
strings. The idea is simpleâ€”encode successive repeated characters by the repetition count and the character.
For example, the RLE of "aaaabcccaa" is "4alb3c2a". The decoding of "3e4f2e" returns "eeeffffee".
Implement run-length encoding and decoding functions. Assume the string to be encoded consists of letters of the
alphabet, with no digits, and the string to be decoded is a valid encoding.
