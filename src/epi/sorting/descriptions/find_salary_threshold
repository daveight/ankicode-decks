You are working in the finance office for ABC corporation. ABC needs to cut payroll expenses to a specified target. The
chief executive officer wants to do this by putting a cap on last year's salaries. Every employee who earned more than
the cap last year will be paid the cap this year; employees who earned no more than the cap will see no change in their
salary. For example, if there were five employees with salaries last year were $90,$30,$100,$40, and $20, and the target
payroll this year is $210, then 60 is a suitable salary cap, since 60 + 30 + 60 + 40 + 20 = 210.
Design an algorithm for computing the salary cap, given existing salaries and the target payroll.
