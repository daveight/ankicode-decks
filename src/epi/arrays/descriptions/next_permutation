Write a program that takes as input a permutation, and returns the next permutation under dictionary ordering. If the
permutation is the last permutation, return the empty array. For example, if the input is (1, 0, 3, 2) your function
should return (1, 2, 0, 3). If the input is (3, 2, 1, 0), return ().
