A number of buildings are visible from a point. A building appears as a rectangle, with the bottom of each building
lying on a fixed horizontal line. A building is specified using its left and right coordinates, and its height.
One building may partly obstruct another. The skyline is the list of coordinates and corresponding heights of what
is visible.
Design an efficient algorithm for computing the skyline.
