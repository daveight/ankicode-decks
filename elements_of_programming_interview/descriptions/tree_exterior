The exterior of a binary tree is the following sequence of nodes: the nodes from the root to the leftmost leaf, followed
by the leaves in left-to-right order, followed by the nodes from the rightmost leaf to the root. (By leftmost
(rightmost) leaf, we mean the leaf that appears first (last) in an inorder traversal.)
Write a program that computes the exterior of a binary tree.
