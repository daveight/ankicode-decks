You are given a binary tree where each node is labeled with an integer. The path weight of a node in such a tree is the
sum of the integers on the unique path from the root to that node.
Write a program which takes as input an integer and a binary tree with integer node weights, and checks if there exists
a leaf whose path weight equals the given integer.
