Description:
Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given 
that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a 
unique set of numbers. 
Ensure that numbers within the set are sorted in ascending order.
Example 1: Input: k = 3, n = 7 Output: [[1,2,4]] 
Example 2: Input: k = 3, n = 9 Output: [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
