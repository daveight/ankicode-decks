Time : O(nk) ; Space: O()
 
Description:
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. 
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. 
You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. 
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. 
For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; 
costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... 
Find the minimum cost to paint all houses. 
Note: All costs are positive integers. 
Follow up: Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?
