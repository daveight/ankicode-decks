Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique 
paths would there be? 
An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid. 
For example, 
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below. 
[ 
 [0,0,0], 
 [0,1,0], 
 [0,0,0] 
] 
The total number of unique paths is 2.
