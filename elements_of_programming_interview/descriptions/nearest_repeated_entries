People do not like reading text in which a word is used multiple times in a short paragraph. You are to write a program
which helps identify such a problem.
Write a program which takes as input an array and finds the distance between a closest pair of equal entries.
For example, if s = ("All", "work", "and", "no", "play", "makes", "for", "no", "work", "no", "fun", "and", "no",
"results"), then the second and third occurrences of "no" is the closest pair.
