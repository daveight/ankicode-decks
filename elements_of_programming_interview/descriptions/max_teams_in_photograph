You are a photographer for a soccer meet. You will be taking pictures of pairs of opposing teams. All teams have the
same number of players. A team photo consists of a front row of players and a back row of players. A player in the back
row must be taller than the player in front of him. All players in a row must be from the
same team.
Determine the largest number of teams that can be photographed simultaneously subject to the same constraints?
