Time : O(N!); Space: O(N!)
 
Description: 
Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all 
possible unique subs. 
For example, 
[1,1,2] have the following unique subs: 
[1,1,2], [1,2,1], and [2,1,1].

P.S.: cannot skip duplicates using while (nums[i] == duplicate) because
after swapping, duplicates may be separated (one duplicate is swapped with
and goes to somewhere else disconnected with other duplicates)
