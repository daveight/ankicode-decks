Write a program which takes as input a string (the "sentence") and an array of strings (the "words"), and returns the
starting indices of substrings of the sentence string which are the concatenation of all the strings in the words array.
Each string must appear exactly once, and their ordering is immaterial. Assume all strings in the words array have equal
length. It is possible for the words array to contain duplicates.
