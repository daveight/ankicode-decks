Time : O() ; Space: O()
 
Description:
Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will 
be initialized with the root node of a BST. 
Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST. 
Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) 
memory, where h is the height of the tree.
