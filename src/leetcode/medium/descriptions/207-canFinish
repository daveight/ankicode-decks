Time : O(); Space : O()
 
Description: 
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1. 
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1] 
Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, 
is it possible for you to finish all courses? 
For example: 
     2, [[1,0]] 
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have 
finished course 0. So it is possible. 
     2, [[1,0],[0,1]] 
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have 
finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished 
course 1. So it is impossible.
