The storage capacity of hard drives dwarfs that of RAM. This can lead to interesting space-time trade-offs.
Suppose you were given a file containing roughly one billion IP addresses, each of which is a 32-bit quantity.
How would you programmatically find an IP address that is not in the file? Assume you have unlimited drive space
but only a few megabytes of RAM at your disposal.
