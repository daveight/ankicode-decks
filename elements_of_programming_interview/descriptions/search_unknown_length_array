Binary search is usually applied to an array of known length. Sometimes, the array is "virtual", i.e., it is an
abstraction of data that is spread across multiple machines. In such cases, the length is not known in advance;
accessing elements beyond the end results in an exception.
Design an algorithm that takes a sorted array whose length is not known, and a key, and returns an index of an array
element which is equal to the key. Assume that an out-of-bounds access throws an exception.
