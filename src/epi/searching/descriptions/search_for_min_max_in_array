Given an array of comparable objects, you can find either the min or the max of the elements in the array with n - 1
comparisons, where n is the length of the array.
Comparing elements may be expensive, e.g., a comparison may involve a number of nested calls or the elements being
compared may be long strings. Therefore, it is natural to ask if both the min and the max can be computed with less than
the 2(n - 1) comparisons required to compute the min and the max independently.
Design an algorithm to find the min and max elements in an array. For example, if A =(3,2,5,1,2,4), you should return
1 for the min and 5 for the max.
