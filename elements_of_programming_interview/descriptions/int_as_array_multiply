Certain applications require arbitrary precision arithmetic. One way to achieve this is to use arrays to represent
integers, e.g., with one digit per array entry, with the most significant digit appearing first, and a negative leading
digit denoting a negative integer. For example, (1,9,3,7,0,7,7,2,1) represents 193707721 and (-7,6,1,8,3,8,2,5,7,2,8,7)
represents-761838257287. Write a program that takes two arrays representing integers, and returns an integer
representing their product. For example, since 193707721 X -761838257287 = -147573952589676412927, if the inputs are
(1,9,3,7,0,7,7,2,1) and (-7,6,1,8,3,8,2,5,7,2,8,7), you should return (-1,4,7,5,7,3,9,5,2,5,8,9,6,7,6,4,1,2,9,2,7).
