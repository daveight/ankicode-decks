Spreadsheets often use an alphabetical encoding of the successive columns. Specifically, columns are identified by
"A", "B", "C", ..., "X", "Y", "Z", "AA", "AB", ..., "ZZ", "AAA", "AAB", ....
Implement a function that converts a spreadsheet column id to the corresponding integer, with "A" corresponding to 1.
For example, you should return 4 for "D", 27 for "AA", 702 for "ZZ", etc. How would you test your code?
