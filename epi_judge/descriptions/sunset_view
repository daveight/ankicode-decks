You are given with a series of buildings that have windows facing west. The buildings are in a straight line, and any
building which is to the east of a building of equal or greater height cannot view the sunset.
Design an algorithm that processes buildings in east-to-west order and returns the set of buildings which view the
sunset. Each building is specified by its height.
