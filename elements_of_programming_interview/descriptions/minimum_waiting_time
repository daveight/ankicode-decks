A database has to respond to a set of client SQL queries. The service time required for each query is known in advance.
For this application, the queries must be processed by the database one at a time, but can be done in any order. The
time a query waits before its turn comes is called its waiting time.
Given service times for a set of queries, compute a schedule for processing the queries that minimizes the total waiting
time. Return the minimum waiting time. For example, if the service times are (2,5,1,3), if we schedule in the given
order, the total waiting time is 0+(2)+(2+5)+(2+5+1) = 17. If however, we schedule queries in order of decreasing
service times, the total waiting time is 0 + (5) + (5 + 3) + (5 + 3 + 2) = 23.
