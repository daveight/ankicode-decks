A string is said to be palindromic if it reads the same backwards and forwards. A decomposition of a string
is a set of strings whose concatenation is the string. For example, "611116" is palindromic, and "611", "11", "6" is
one decomposition for it. Compute all palindromic decompositions of a given string.
For example, if the string is "0204451881", then the decomposition "020", "44", "5", "1881" is palindromic,
as is "020", "44", "5", "1", "88", "1". However, "02044, "5", "1881" is not a palindromic decomposition.
