Time : O(N^2); Space : O(N)
 
Description: 
Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form 
the largest number. 
For example, given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330. 
Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
