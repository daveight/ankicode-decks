Time : O(); Space : O()
 
Description: 
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string. 
The expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ), 
the plus + or minus sign -, non-negative integers and empty spaces . 
You may assume that the given expression is always valid. 
Some examples: 
 "1 + 1" = 2 
 " 2-1 + 2 " = 3 
 "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)" = 23 
 
Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.
