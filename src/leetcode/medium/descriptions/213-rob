Description: 
After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself 
a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. 
This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means 
the first house is the neighbor of the last one.  Each house has a certain 
amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing 
each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and 
it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were 
broken into on the same night.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money
of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob 
tonight without alerting the police.
