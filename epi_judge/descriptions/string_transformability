Let s and t be strings and D a dictionary, i.e., a set of strings. Define s to produce t if there exists a sequence of
strings from the dictionary P = (S0,S1,...,Sn-1) such that the first string is s, the last string is f, and adjacent
strings have the same length and differ in exactly one character. The sequence P is called a production sequence.
For example, if the dictionary is {bat,cot,dog,dag,dot,cat), then (cat,cot,dot,dog) is production sequence.
Given a dictionary D and two strings s and f, write a program to determine if s produces t. Assume that all characters
are lowercase alphabets. If s does produce f, output the length of a shortest production sequence; otherwise, output -1.
