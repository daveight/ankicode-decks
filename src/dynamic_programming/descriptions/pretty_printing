Consider the problem of laying out text using a fixed width font. Each line can hold no more than a fixed number of
characters. Words on a line are to be separated by exactly one blank. Therefore, we may be left with whitespace at the
end of a line (since the next word will not fit in the remaining space). This whitespace is visually unappealing.

Given text, i.e., a string of words separated by single blanks, decompose the text into lines such that no word is
split across lines and the messiness of the decomposition is minimized. Each line can hold no more than a specified
number of characters.
