Description: 
 
Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the 
numerically next greater permutation of numbers. 
If such arrangement is not possible, it must be rearranged as the 
lowest possible order ie, sorted in an ascending order. 
The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory. 
Examples: 
 1,2,3 → 1,3,2 
 3,2,1 → 1,2,3 
 1,1,5 → 1,5,1 
 20, 50, 113 → 20, 113, 50 
 
Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding 
outputs are in the right-hand column.
