Description: 
Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the 
successive elements in its sorted form. 
Try to solve it in linear time/space. 
Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements. 
You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and 
fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
