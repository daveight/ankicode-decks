You want to compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. The sequence is presented to you in a streaming
fashionâ€”you cannot back up to read an earlier value, and you need to output the median after reading in each new
element. For example, if theinputis1,0,3,5,2,0,1 the output is 1,0.5,1,2,2,1.5,1.
Design an algorithm for computing the running median of a sequence.
