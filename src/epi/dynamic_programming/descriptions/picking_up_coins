In the pick-up-coins game, an even number of coins are placed in a line. Two players take turns at choosing one coin
eachâ€”they can only choose from the two coins at the ends of the line. The game ends when all the coins have been picked
up. The player whose coins have the higher total value wins. A player cannot pass his turn.
Design an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum total value for the starting player in the pick-up-coins game.
