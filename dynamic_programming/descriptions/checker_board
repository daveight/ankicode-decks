Consider a checkerboard with NxN squares and a cost function c(i, j), which returns a cost associates with
square (i, j). Let us say there was a checker that could start at any square on the first row and you wanted
to know the shortest path (the sum of minimum costs at each visited row) to get to the last row.
The checker could move only diagonally left forward, diagonally right forward, or straight forward.

Design an algorithm which calculates the shortest path with minimum cost to reach the top row starting from any
point at the first row

Parameters:
    - cost - 2d array NxN which contains costs for every square

Example:
3| 0 1 2        3| 0
2| 2 1 2    =>  2|   1        Output: [3,2,1], total cost = 2
1| 3 3 1        1|     1
