You are climbing stairs. You can advance 1 to k steps at a time. Your destination is exactly n steps up.
Write a program which takes as inputs n and k and returns the number of ways in which you can get to your destination.
For example, if n = 4 and k = 2, there are five ways in which to get to the destination:
• four single stair advances,
• two single stair advances followed by a double stair advance,
• a single stair advance followed by a double stair advance followed by a single stair advance,
• a double stair advance followed by two single stairs advances, and • two double stair advances.
