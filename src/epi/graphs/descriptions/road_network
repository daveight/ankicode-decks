The California Department of Transportation is considering adding a new section of highway to the California Highway
System. Each highway section connects two cities. City officials have submitted proposals for the new highway each
proposal includes the pair of cities being connected and the length of the section.
Write a program which takes the existing highway network (specified as a set of highway sections between pairs of
cities) and proposals for new highway sections, and returns the proposed highway section which leads to the most
improvement in the total driving distance. The total driving distance is defined to be the sum of the shortest path
distances between all pairs of cities. All sections, existing and proposed, allow for bi-directional traffic, and the
original network is connected.
