Time : O(N); Space: O(1)
 
Description:
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so 
that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order 
red, white and blue. 
Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, 
white, and blue respectively. 
Note: 
You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
