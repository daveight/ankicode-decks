Given two BSTs, it is straightforward to create a BST containing the union of their keys: traverse one, and insert its
keys into the other. Design an algorithm that takes as input two BSTs and merges them to form a balanced BST.
For any node, you can update its left and right subtree fields, but cannot change its key.
Your solution can dynamically allocate no more than a few bytes.
