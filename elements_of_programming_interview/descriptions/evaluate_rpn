A string is said to be an arithmetical expression in Reverse Polish notation (RPN) if:
(1.) It is a single digit or a sequence of digits, prefixed with an option -, e.g., "6", "123", "-42".
(2.) It is of the form“A,B,o" where A and B are RPN expressions and o is one of +/-/X, /•
For example, the following strings satisfy these rules: "1729", "3,4,+,2,X,1,+", "1,1,+,-2,x","-641,6,/,28,/".
Write a program that takes an arithmetical expression in RPN and returns the number that the expression evaluates to.
