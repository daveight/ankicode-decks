Given a set of time intervals in any order, merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should
have only mutually exclusive intervals. Let the intervals be represented as pairs of integers for simplicity. For
example, let the given set of intervals be {{1,3}, {2,4}, {5,7}, {6,8}}. The intervals {1,3} and {2,4} overlap with
each other, so they should be merged and become {1, 4}. Similarly, {5, 7} and {6, 8} should be merged and become {5, 8}
