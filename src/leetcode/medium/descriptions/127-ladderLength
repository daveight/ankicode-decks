Description: 
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary, find the 
length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, 
such that: 
     Only one letter can be changed at a time 
     Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary 
For example, 
Given: start = "hit" end = "cog" 
dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"] 
As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", 
return its length 5.
