The direct implementation of an inorder traversal using recursion has 0(h) space complexity, where h is the height of
the tree. Recursion can be removed with an explicit stack, but the space complexity remains 0(h).
Write a non-recursive program for computing the inorder traversal sequence for a binary tree. Assume nodes have
parent fields.
