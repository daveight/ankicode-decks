 Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, nums,
 return all possible subsets. 
 
 Note: 
 Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order. 
 The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. 
 
 For example, 
 If nums = [1,2,2], a solution is:
     [ [2], [1], [1,2,2], [2,2], [1,2], [] ]
