Description: 
Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its 
nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root). 
For example: 
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7}, 
   3 
  / \ 
 9  20 
   /  \
  15   7 
return its bottom-up level order traversal as: 
[ [15,7], [9,20], [3] ]
