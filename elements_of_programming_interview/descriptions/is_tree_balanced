A binary tree is said to be height-balanced if for each node in the tree, the difference in the height of its left and
right subtrees is at most one. A perfect binary tree is height-balanced, as is a complete binary tree. A height-balanced
binary tree does not have to be perfect or complete.
Write a program that takes as input the root of a binary tree and checks whether the tree is height-balanced.
