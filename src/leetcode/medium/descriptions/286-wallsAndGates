Description:
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values. 
1. -1 - A wall or an obstacle. 
2. 0 - A gate. 
3. INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 
to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is 
impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF. 
For example, given the 2D grid: 
INF  -1  0  INF 
INF INF INF  -1 
INF  -1 INF  -1 
0  -1 INF INF 
After running your function, the 2D grid should be: 
3  -1   0   1 
2   2   1  -1 
1  -1   2  -1 
0  -1   3   4
