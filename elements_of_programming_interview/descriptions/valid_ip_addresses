A decimal string is a string consisting of digits between 0 and 9. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses can be written as
four decimal strings separated by periods, e.g., 192.168.1.201. A careless programmer mangles a string representing an
IP address in such a way that all the periods vanish.
Write a program that determines where to add periods to a decimal string so that the resulting string is a valid IP
address. There may be more than one valid IP address corresponding to a string, in which case you should print all
possibilities.
