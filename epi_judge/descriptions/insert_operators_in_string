Consider an expression of the form (3 O 1 O 4 O 1 O 5), where each O is an operator, e.g., +, x,+.
The expression takes different values based on what the operators are. Some examples are 14 (if all operators are +),
60 (if all operators are x), and 22 (3 - 1 + 4 X 1 X 5).
Write a program that takes an array of digits and a target value, and returns true if it is possible to intersperse
multiplies (x) and adds (+) with the digits of the array such that the resulting expression evaluates to the target
value. For example, if the array is (1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9} and the target value is 995, then the target value
can be realized by the expression 123 + 2 + 5 x 3 x 7 + 85 x 9, so your program should return true.
