Write a program which takes as input an array of digits encoding a decimal number D and updates the array to represent
the number D + 1. For example, if the input 65 is (1,2,9) then you should update the array to (1,3,0).
Your algorithm should work even if it is implemented in a language that has finite-precision arithmetic.
