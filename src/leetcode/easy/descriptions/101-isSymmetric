Description: 
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center). 
For example, this binary tree is symmetric: 
    1
   / \ 
  2   2
 / \ / \ 
3  4 4  3 
But the following is not: 
   1 
  / \ 
 2   2 
  \   \ 
   3    3 
Note: 
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
