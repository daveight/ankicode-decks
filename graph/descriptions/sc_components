A directed graph is called strongly connected if there is a path in each direction between each pair of vertices of
the graph. That is, a path exists from the first vertex in the pair to the second, and another path exists from the
second vertex to the first. In a directed graph G that may not itself be strongly connected, a pair of vertices u
and v are said to be strongly connected to each other if there is a path in each direction between them.

For example:
[0: [2, 3],            (1) -> (0) -> (3)
 1: [0],       =>       ^      |      |
 2: [1],                |      |      v
 3: [4],               (2) <----     (4)
 4: []]

This graph has the following strongly connected components:
[0, 1, 2]
[3]
[4]
