```python
def square_root(k):
    left, right = 0, k
    # Candidate interval [left, right] where everything before left has square
    # <= k, everything after right has square > k.
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        mid_squared = mid * mid
        if mid_squared <= k:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return left - 1
