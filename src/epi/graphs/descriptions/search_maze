It is natural to apply graph models and algorithms to spatial problems. Consider a black and white digitized image of a
maze white pixels represent open areas and black spaces are walls. There are two special white pixels: one is designated
the entrance and the other is the exit. The goal in this problem is to find a way of getting from the entrance to the
exit.
Given a 2D array of black and white entries representing a maze with designated entrance and exit points, find a path
from the entrance to the exit, if one exists.
