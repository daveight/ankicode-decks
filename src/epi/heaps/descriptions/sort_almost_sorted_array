Often data is almost sorted for example, a server receives timestamped stock quotes and earlier quotes may arrive
slightly after later quotes because of differences in server loads and network routes. In this problem we address
efficient ways to sort such data.
Write a program which takes as input a very long sequence of numbers and prints the numbers in sorted order.
Each number is at most k away from its correctly sorted position. (Such an array is sometimes referred to as being for
example, no number in the sequence (3,-1,2,6,4,5,8} is more than 2 away from its final sorted position.
