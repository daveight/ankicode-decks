A good string search algorithm is fundamental to the performance of many applications. Several clever algorithms have
been proposed for string search, each with its own trade-offs. As a result, there is no single perfect answer.
If someone asks you this question in an interview, the best way to approach this problem would be to work through one
good algorithm in detail and discuss at a high level other algorithms.
Given two strings s (the "search string") and t (the "text"), find the first occurrence of s in t.
