Define a path in the triangle to be a sequence of entries in the triangle in which adjacent entries in the sequence
correspond to entries that are adjacent in the triangle. The path must start at the top, descend the triangle
continuously, and end with an entry on the bottom row. The weight of a path is the sum of the entries.
Write a program that takes as input a triangle of numbers and returns the weight of a minimum weight path.
