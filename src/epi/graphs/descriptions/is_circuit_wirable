Consider a collection of electrical pins on a printed circuit board (PCB). For each pair of pins, there may or may not
be a wire joining them. This is shown in Figure 19.8, where vertices correspond to pins, and edges indicate the presence
of a wire between pins. (The significance of the colors is explained later.)
Design an algorithm that takes a set of pins and a set of wires connecting pairs of pins, and determines if it is
possible to place some pins on the left half of a PCB, and the remainder on the right half, such that each wire is
between left and right halves. Return such a division, if one exists.
