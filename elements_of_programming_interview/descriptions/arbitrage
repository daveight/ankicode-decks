Arbitrage is the process of using discrepancies in currency exchange values to earn profit.

Consider a person who starts with some amount of currency X, goes through a series of exchanges and finally ends up
with more amount of X(than he initially had). Given n currencies and a table (nxn) of exchange rates, devise an
algorithm that a person should use to avail maximum profit assuming that he doesn't perform one exchange more than once.
