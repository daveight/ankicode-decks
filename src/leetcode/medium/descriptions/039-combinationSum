Description: 
Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all 
unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T. 
The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times. 
Note: All numbers (including target) will be positive integers. 
Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending 
order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak). 
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations. 
For example, given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7, 
A solution set is: 
 [7] 
 [2, 2, 3]
