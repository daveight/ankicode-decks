In an American football game, a play can lead to 2 points (safety), 3 points (field goal), or 7 points (touchdown,
assuming the extra point). Many different combinations of 2, 3, and 7 point plays can make up a final score. For
example, four combinations of plays yield a score of 12:
• 6 safeties (2x6=12),
• 3 safeties and 2 field goals (2x3+3x2=12), •1safety,1fieldgoaland1touchdown(2x1+3x1+7x1 =12),a nd
• 4 field goals (3x4=12).
Write a program that takes a final score and scores for individual plays, and returns the number of combinations of
plays that result in the final score.
