This problem is concerned with deleting repeated elements from a sorted array. For example, for the array
(2,3,5,5,7,11,11,11,13), then after deletion, the array is (2,3,5,7,11,13,0,0,0). After deleting repeated elements,
there are 6 valid entries. There are no requirements as to the values stored beyond the last valid element.
Write a program which takes as input a sorted array and updates it so that all duplicates have been removed and the
remaining elements have been shifted left to fill the emptied indices. Return the number of valid elements.
