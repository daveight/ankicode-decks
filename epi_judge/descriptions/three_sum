Design an algorithm that takes as input an array and a number, and determines if there are three entries in the array
(not necessarily distinct) which add up to the specified number. For example, if the array is (11,2,5,7,3) then there
are three entries in the array which add up to 21 (3,7,11 and 5,5,11). (Note that we can use 5 twice, since the problem
statement said we can use the same entry more than once.) However, no three entries add up to 22.
