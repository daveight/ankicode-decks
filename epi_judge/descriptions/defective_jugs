You have three measuring jugs, A, B, and C. The measuring marks have worn out, making it impossible to measure
exact volumes. Specifically, each time you measure with A, all you can be sure of is that you have a volume
that is in the range [230, 240] mL. (The next time you use A, you may get a different volumeâ€”all that you know
with certainty is that the quantity will be in [230, 240] mL.) Jugs B and C can be used to measure a volume in
[290,310] mL and in [500,515] mL, respectively. Your recipe for chocolate chip cookies calls for at least 2100 mL
and no more than 2300 mL of milk.

Write a program that determines if there exists a sequence of steps by which the required amount of milk can be
obtained using the worn-out jugs.
