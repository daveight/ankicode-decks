Strings in which parens are matched are defined by the following three rules:
- The empty string, '', is a string in which parens are matched.
- The addition of a leading left parens and a trailing right parens to a string in which parens are matched results
  in a string in which parens are matched. For example, since '(())()' is a string with matched parens, so is '((())())'.
- The concatenation of two strings in which parens are matched is itself a string in which parens are matched.
For example, since '(())()' and '()' are strings with matched parens, so is '(())()()'.
