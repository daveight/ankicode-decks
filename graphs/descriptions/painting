Let A be a Boolean 2D array encoding a black-and-white image. The entry A(a,b) can be viewed as encoding the color at
entry (a,b). Call two entries adjacent if one is to the left, right, above or below the other. Note that the definition
implies that an entry can be adjacent to at most four other entries, and that adjacency is symmetric, i.e., if eO is
adjacent to entry el, then el is adjacent to eO.
Implement a routine that takes an n X m Boolean array A together with an entry (x, y) and flips the color of the region
associated with (x, y).
