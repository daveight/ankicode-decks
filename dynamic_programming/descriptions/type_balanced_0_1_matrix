Consider the problem of assigning values, either zero or one, to the positions of an n x n matrix,
with n even, so that each row and each column contains exactly n / 2 zeros and n / 2 ones.
We ask how many different assignments there are for a given n.

For example, when n = 4, four possible solutions are

 0 1 0 1    0 0 1 1    1 1 0 0    1 0 0 1
 1 0 1 0    0 0 1 1    0 0 1 1    0 1 1 0
 0 1 0 1    1 1 0 0    1 1 0 0    0 1 1 0
 1 0 1 0    1 1 0 0    0 0 1 1    1 0 0 1


Determine count of possible solutions for n given.
