A peg contains rings in sorted order, with the largest ring being the lowest. You are to transfer these rings to another
peg. Write a program which prints a sequence of operations that transfers n rings from one peg to another.
You have a third peg, which is initially empty. The only operation you can perform is taking a single ring from the
top of one peg and placing it on the top of another peg. You must never place a larger ring above a smaller ring.
