Each digit, apart from 0 and 1, in a phone keypad corresponds to one of three or four letters of the alphabet.
Since words are easier to remember than numbers, it is natural to ask if a 7 or 10-digit phone number can be represented
by a word. For example, "2276696" corresponds to "ACRONYM" as well as "ABPOMZN".
Write a program which takes as input a phone number, specified as a string of digits, and returns all possible character
sequences that correspond to the phone number. The cell phone keypad is specified by a mapping that takes a digit and
returns the corresponding set of characters. The character sequences do not have to be legal words or phrases.
