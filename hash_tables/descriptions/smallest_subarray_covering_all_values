Write a program that takes two arrays of strings, and return the indices of the start¬ ing and ending index of a
shortest subarray of the first array (the "paragraph" array) that "sequentially covers", i.e., contains all the strings
in the second array (the "keywords" array), in the order in which they appear in the keywords array. You can assume all
keywords are distinct. For example, let the paragraph array be (apple,banana,cat,apple), and the keywords array be
(banana,apple). The para¬ graph subarray starting at index 0 and ending at index 1 does not fulfill the specification,
even though it contains all the keywords, since they do not appear in the specified order. On the other hand, the
subarray starting at index 1 and ending at index 3 does fulfill the specification.
