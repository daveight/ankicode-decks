Time : O(N); Space : O(1)
 
Description: 
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find 
the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't 
one, return 0 instead. 
For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7, 
the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint. 
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution 
of which the time complexity is O(n log n).
