Write a program which takes text for an anonymous letter and text for a magazine and determines if it is possible to
write the anonymous letter using the magazine. The anonymous letter can be written using the magazine if for each
character in the anonymous letter, the number of times it appears in the anonymous letter is no more than the number of
times it appears in the magazine.
