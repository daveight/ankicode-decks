Write a program which takes as input two sorted arrays, and returns a new array containing elements that are present in
both of the input arrays. The input arrays may have duplicate entries, but the returned array should be free of
duplicates. For example, the input is (2,3,3,5,5,6,7,7,8,12) and (5,5,6,8,8,9,10,10), your output should be (5,6,8).
