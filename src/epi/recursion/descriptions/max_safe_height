You need to test the design of a protective case. Specifically, the case can protect the enclosed device from a fall
from up to some number of floors, and you want to determine what that number of floors is. You can assume the following:
• All cases have identical physical properties. In particular, if one breaks when falling from a particular level, all
  of them will break when falling from that level.
• A case that survives a fall can be used again, and a broken case must be discarded.
• If a case breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor, and if a case survives a fall,
  then it would survive a shorter fall.

It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that eggs can survive the 36th-floor
windows. An additional constraint is that you can perform only a fixed number of drops before the building supervisor
stops you.

If we have two cases and are allowed 5 drops, we can do better. For example, we could test by dropping from floors 2, 4,
6, 8, 9. If a case breaks on the first four drops, we have narrowed the critical floor to that floor or the one below
it. We can test the one below it with the second case. If the case breaks on the fifth drop, we know the critical floor
is 9. If the case does not break, we know it is able to last to a ninth floor drop. Clearly having two cases is better
than one.

Given c cases and a maximum of d allowable drops, what is the maximum number of floors that you can test in the
worst-case?
