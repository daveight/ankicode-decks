Given two singly linked lists there may be list nodes that are common to both.
(This may not be a bugâ€”it may be desirable from the perspective of reducing memory footprint, as in the flyweight
pattern, or maintaining a canonical form.)
Write a program that takes two cycle-free singly linked lists, and determines if there exists a node that is common
to both lists.
