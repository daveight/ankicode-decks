You are reading a sequence of strings. You know a priori that more than half the strings are repetitions of a single
string (the "majority element") but the positions where the majority element occurs are unknown. Write a program that
makes a single pass over the sequence and identifies the majority element. For example, if the input is
(b,a,c,a,a,b,a,a,c,a), then a is the majority element (it appears in 6 out of the 10 places).
