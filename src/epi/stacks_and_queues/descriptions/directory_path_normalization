A file or directory can be specified via a string called the pathname. This string may specify an absolute path,
starting from the root, e.g., /usr/bin/gcc, or a path relative to the current working directory, e.g.,
scripts/awkscripts. The same directory may be specified by multiple directory paths. For example,
/usr/lib/../bin/gcc and scripts//./,./scripts/awkscripts/././ specify equivalent absolute and relative pathnames.

Write a program which takes a pathname, and returns the shortest equivalent pathname.
